### ðŸš€ðŸ”¥ Following are some areas where VITE is actually better than CRA during development:

1. Development speed

- VITE is an ultra-fast development server when compared with CRA's decent development server.

2. Performance

- VITE is known for its optimized production builds, which result in faster loads.

VITE is best suited for small to medium projects, but CRA(Create React App) is recommended when working on larger projects.

\*\*\* In conclusion, both VITE and CRA are powerful tools for building React applications. Your choice should be based on specific project needs.
