## WHAT IS REACT?
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for web applications. It was created by Facebook and is maintained by both Facebook and a community of developers. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of these components efficiently. One of its key features is the use of a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which improves performance by minimizing the number of direct manipulations to the actual DOM. React follows a component-based architecture, where UIs are built using reusable components that manage their own state. This approach promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability in large applications.
